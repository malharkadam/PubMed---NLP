### Get data

Before we can start building a model, we've got to download the PubMed 200k RCT dataset.

In a phenomenal act of kindness, the authors of the paper have made the data they used for their research availably publically and for free in the form of .txt files [on GitHub](https://github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/pubmed-rct).

We can copy them to our local directory using `git clone https://github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/pubmed-rct`.
